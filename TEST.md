# Virtual Stack Machine/Variable declarations

22/04/2024 ~ Compilers stack machine declaration ~ How can i up date the compilers stack machine declaration

In the [previous article](/everyday/04-21-2022-compilers-how-virtual-stack-machines-executed), we get an overview of how bytecode is executed in a stack machine.

In this article, we continue to dive into the details of a different scenario: **Variable declaration**.

In the simple language that we are designing, there will be 3 types of variable declaration:

1. Variable with a constant value
2. Variable with a value from other variables
3. Variable with a value from an expression

   In the following program, we have all 3 declaration types above:

```go
var x = 10      // type 1
var y = x       // type 2
var z = 15 + x  // type 3
```

```js
const hello = 1;
```

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")

hello_world()
```
